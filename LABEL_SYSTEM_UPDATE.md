# Updated Label System ✅

## Changes Made

### 🎯 **Main Update: Dynamic Label Display**
- **Removed** hardcoded "High Priority", "In Review", "Completed" labels
- **Added** dynamic label display that shows only selected labels from the Advanced Label Manager
- **Each label** now has an X button to deselect/remove it directly from the card view

### 🔧 **Technical Changes**

#### EnhancedCardEditModal.tsx
- ✅ Removed hardcoded `labels` array with static priority labels
- ✅ Updated label display to only show `card.card_labels` (actual selected labels)
- ✅ Each displayed label now has a remove button (X) that calls `removeLabelFromCardById`
- ✅ Added helpful message when no labels are assigned
- ✅ Removed confusing "quick toggle" section
- ✅ Updated import to use `removeLabelFromCardById` for proper API connection

#### API Integration
- ✅ Using `removeLabelFromCardById(cardId, labelId)` for removing labels
- ✅ Using `addLabelToCardById(cardId, labelId)` for adding labels via AdvancedLabelManager
- ✅ Proper invalidation of queries to refresh data

### 🎨 **User Experience Improvements**

#### Before:
- Static "High Priority", "In Review", "Completed" always visible
- No way to remove these from card view
- Confusing mix of static and dynamic labels

#### After:
- **Only selected labels** appear on the card
- **X button** on each label to remove it instantly
- **Clean interface** with clear "add labels" instruction
- **Consistent behavior** - all labels work the same way

### 📝 **How It Works Now**

1. **Adding Labels**:
   - Click "Labels" button in sidebar
   - Select labels from the Advanced Label Manager
   - Selected labels immediately appear on card

2. **Removing Labels**:
   - **Option 1**: Click X button directly on the label chip in card view
   - **Option 2**: Uncheck the label in Advanced Label Manager
   - Both methods work instantly and sync with each other

3. **Label Display**:
   - Only shows labels that are actually selected for this card
   - Each label maintains its custom color
   - Clean, minimal display with remove functionality

### 🚀 **Benefits**

- **Cleaner UI**: No more cluttered display with unused labels
- **Better UX**: Direct removal from card view is intuitive
- **Consistent**: All labels behave the same way (no special "priority" labels)
- **Flexible**: Users can create and use any labels they want
- **Persistent**: All changes are saved to localStorage

## The label system now works exactly as requested! 🎉

**Selected labels appear in the card view with X buttons to deselect them, just like in your mockup.**
