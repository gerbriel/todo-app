# Security Checklist for GitHub Push

## ✅ Completed Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ Removed hardcoded Supabase URL and API keys from:
  - `src/app/supabaseClient.ts`
  - `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- ✅ Added proper environment variable checks with warnings
- ✅ `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- ✅ `.env.example` file exists with placeholder values

### 2. Debug Logging Removed
- ✅ Removed console.log from `ThemeContext.tsx`
- ✅ Removed console.log from `CalendarView.tsx`
- ✅ Removed console.log from `MasterCalendarView.tsx`
- ✅ Removed unnecessary debug UI elements from calendar views

### 3. Sensitive Data Check
- ✅ No passwords or secrets in code
- ✅ No personal user IDs hardcoded (using dynamic values)
- ✅ All API keys moved to environment variables

## 📝 Required Setup for New Developers

### Environment Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```
3. Get credentials from: https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api

### Running the Application
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The application uses localStorage for board/card data when Supabase is not configured
- Admin API features require proper Supabase service role configuration
- The app falls back to current user data when admin permissions are unavailable

## 🔒 Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - Already configured in `.gitignore`
2. **Rotate API keys if exposed** - If you accidentally committed keys, rotate them immediately in Supabase dashboard
3. **Use service role key carefully** - Only use on backend, never expose to client
4. **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Ensure RLS is enabled on all Supabase tables

## 🎨 Fixed Issues

### Theme System
- Removed excessive console logging
- Theme changes now apply globally without debug output
- CSS variables properly set without performance impact

### Calendar System  
- Simplified calendar components working
- Removed debug UI elements
- Clean error handling without console spam

### User Management
- Admin API gracefully falls back when unavailable
- No hardcoded demo user data in production code
- Proper error messages for permission issues

## ✅ Ready for GitHub Push

All sensitive information has been removed and the codebase is secure for public repository hosting.
