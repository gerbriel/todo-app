## 📅 **Calendar Features in Detail**

### Spanning Cards
Cards automatically span across multiple calendar dates with intelligent row breaking. When a card spans multiple days:
- Continues seamlessly across the same row
- Breaks to the next row when reaching week boundaries
- Maintains visual continuity with connecting segments

### Dynamic Heights
Calendar cells adjust their height automatically based on content:
- Base height for date display
- Additional height per card lane needed
- Smooth scaling for different numbers of overlapping events

### Lane Assignment
Smart algorithm prevents card overlap:
- Assigns each card to the first available lane
- Considers the entire span of multi-day cards
- Maintains consistent lane assignment across card segments

## 🗄️ **Database Schema**

The app uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with:
- **Workspaces**: Multi-tenant organization
- **Boards & Lists**: Hierarchical project structure  
- **Cards**: Rich task/event objects with dates, metadata
- **Labels & Custom Fields**: Flexible categorization
- **Checklists**: Task breakdown and workflows
- **Activity Logs**: Complete audit trails
- **Row Level Security**: Secure multi-user access
