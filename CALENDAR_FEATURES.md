# Calendar Drag-and-Drop & Cross-Board Movement Features

## ðŸš€ New Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Calendar View with Drag-and-Drop
- **Spanning Cards**: Cards now display as single continuous bars that span across multiple date cells when they have different start and end dates
- **Drag-and-Drop Date Updates**: Cards can be dragged to different calendar dates to update their start/end dates
- **Date Range Preservation**: When moving cards with date ranges, the duration is maintained
- **Visual Feedback**: Cards show hover states and visual feedback during drag operations
- **Status-Based Colors**: Cards display different colors based on their status (completed, in-progress, blocked, on-hold)

### 2. Cross-Board Card Movement
- **Move to Board Menu**: Cards now have a "Move to Board" option in their action menu
- **Board/List Selection**: Users can select both the target board and specific list for moving cards
- **Hierarchical Menu**: Clean UI showing boards with their lists in a nested menu structure
- **Position Handling**: Cards are automatically positioned at the end of the target list

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Components Created/Modified

#### New Components:
- `CardActionMenu.tsx`: Enhanced action menu specifically for cards with move functionality
- `CalendarView.tsx`: Complete rebuild with drag-and-drop infrastructure

#### Enhanced Components:
- `SortableCard.tsx`: Updated to use new CardActionMenu with cross-board movement support
- `Board.tsx`: Added support for cross-board movement props
- `SortableList.tsx`: Pass-through for new move functionality
- `DemoPage.tsx`: Central state management for all new features

### Key Features:

#### Calendar Drag-and-Drop:
```typescript
// Date update handler
const handleUpdateCardDates = (cardId: string, startDate: string, endDate: string) => {
  // Updates card dates while maintaining data integrity
}

// Spanning card calculation
const getCardPlacements = () => {
  // Calculates grid positions for cards that span multiple days
}
```

#### Cross-Board Movement:
```typescript
// Move card between boards
const handleMoveCardToBoard = (cardId: string, targetBoardId: string, targetListId: string) => {
  // Removes card from source location and adds to target location
}
```

### Drag-and-Drop Infrastructure:
- Uses `@dnd-kit/core` for both calendar and board interactions
- Maintains separate DnD contexts for different interaction types
- Provides visual feedback with drag overlays
- Handles collision detection and drop validation

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Improvements

### Calendar Interface:
- **Month Navigation**: Previous/next month buttons with clear month/year display
- **Today Indicator**: Visual highlight for the current date
- **Status Legend**: Color-coded legend showing card status meanings
- **Responsive Grid**: 7-column calendar grid with proper spacing
- **Card Tooltips**: Hover tooltips showing card title and date range

### Card Actions:
- **Contextual Menus**: Different actions available based on card state (archived vs active)
- **Submenu Navigation**: Smooth transition to board/list selection submenu
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear organization of available boards and their lists
- **Smart Filtering**: Only shows non-archived boards and lists as move targets

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Efficient Rendering**: Cards calculated and positioned using CSS Grid
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Strategic use of React hooks and memoization
- **Smooth Animations**: Hardware-accelerated transforms for drag operations

## ðŸ”„ State Management

### Centralized Updates:
All card operations flow through DemoPage state handlers:
- Date updates propagate to all views (board, calendar)
- Cross-board moves maintain referential integrity
- Archive status is preserved during moves
- Position calculations handle list ordering

### Data Flow:
```
DemoPage (State) â†’ Board â†’ SortableList â†’ SortableCard â†’ CardActionMenu
                â†“
              CalendarView â†’ DraggableCalendarCard
```

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Examples

### Calendar Drag-and-Drop:
1. Switch to Calendar view
2. Drag any card with dates to a different calendar date
3. Card dates update automatically
4. Cards with date ranges maintain their duration

### Cross-Board Movement:
1. Click the three-dot menu on any card
2. Select "Move to Board"
3. Choose target board and list from submenu
4. Card moves instantly with updated position
