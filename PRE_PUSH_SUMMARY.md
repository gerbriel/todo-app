# Pre-Push Summary

## âœ… Security & Cleanup Complete

### Fixed Issues:

1. **ðŸ”’ Removed Hardcoded Credentials**
   - Removed Supabase URL from `src/app/supabaseClient.ts`
   - Removed Supabase anon key from `src/app/supabaseClient.ts`
   - Removed Supabase URL from `src/lib/supabase.ts`
   - Removed Supabase anon key from `src/lib/supabase.ts`
   - Added environment variable checks with warnings

2. **ðŸ§¹ Removed Debug Console Logs**
   - `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` - Removed theme application logs
   - `src/pages/CalendarView.tsx` - Removed component render logs
   - `src/pages/MasterCalendarView.tsx` - Removed component render logs

3. **ðŸŽ¨ Cleaned Up UI**
   - Removed yellow debug banner from CalendarView
   - Removed blue debug banner from MasterCalendarView
   - Cleaned up unnecessary user auth imports

4. **âœ… Verification Complete**
   - All files compile without errors
   - No TypeScript errors
   - .env files properly ignored
   - .env.example file exists with placeholders

### What's Safe to Push:

âœ… All source code files
âœ… Package.json and dependencies
âœ… Configuration files
âœ… Documentation files
âœ… .gitignore (protects .env)
âœ… .env.example (has placeholders only)

### What's Protected (Won't Push):

ðŸ”’ .env files (contains real credentials)
ðŸ”’ node_modules (dependencies)
ðŸ”’ dist folder (build output)
ðŸ”’ *.local files

### Required for New Setup:

Anyone cloning the repo will need to:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add their own Supabase credentials
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`

## ðŸš€ Ready to Push!

Your codebase is now secure and ready for GitHub. All sensitive information has been removed and proper environment variable setup is documented.

### Quick Git Commands:

```bash
# Check what will be committed
git status

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "feat: complete app with theme system, calendar, and user management
